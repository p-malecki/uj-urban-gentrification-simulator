Urban growth and gentrification modeling. Simulate urban growth and gentrification using agent-based model. The model should capture how residents, developers, and policies interact over time, influencing housing prices, migration, and neighborhood evolution. The city can be modeled aa a grid based system, where each cell represents a neighborhood or housing unit and has an initial property value. The agents of the system are the residents, that have an income level, the developers and identify low-cost properties to purchase and upgrade and government policies, like tax incentives, zoning laws or rent control. Questions that can be answered:
* How does gentrification emerge in an agent-based city model?
* What factors accelerate or slow down gentrification?
* How do different government policies impact urban growth?
